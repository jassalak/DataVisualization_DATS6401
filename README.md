+ The data was obtained from https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center .
+ There was minor pre-processing done using MS Excel, and saved as .csv format.
+ The .csv format was imported into Tableau and then saved on Tableau public ( https://public.tableau.com/profile/akash.jassal#!/vizhome/DATS6401-FinalProject-AkashJassal-TableauDashboard/TreeMap )
+ The .csv was converted to .json via an online converter, then used by the main.js script to create visualizations using d3 library.
